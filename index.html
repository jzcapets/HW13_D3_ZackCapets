			  <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Demographics</h2>
			  <p>It should come as no surprise that there is a negative correlation between income and obesity, that is to say, as income increases the average state-wide obesity percentage decreases. At the individual level, with increased average income comes access to healthier foods, better eating habits, and more time for exercise.</p>

			  <p>The Deep South and Southeast stand out as areas with the lowest incomes and highest obesity percentages, while the Northeast tends to fall on the opposite end of the spectrum with higher incomes and lower obesity percentages. Outdoorsy Colorado stands out as the state with lowest obesity percentage, and even there over one in five people is considered obese (21.3%)! Arkansas currently has the highest obesity percentage with over one in three people classed as obese.</p>

			  <p>All that said, high average annual income does not guarantee low obesity percentages (though the opposite is almost certainly true). Of the 5 states with average per-capita incomes above $70,000/year there was an 8%+ range in obesity rates. Conversely, among the states with average per-capita incomes of $45,000 or less there was only a 4% spread in obesity rates. That is to say low income is a better predictor of obesity rates than high income is.</p>
